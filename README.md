# UKFSR2024

Codebase for the UK Food Security Report. This is part of the UKFSR
infrastructure, which comprises a number of elements. The public elements are
listed below:

- **this repo**. Here you will find mostly the code used to produce the graphics in the UKFSR, alongside some supporting code.
- the [ukfsr](https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr) package. This R package is intended to contain helper functions to assist in the production of the report, mostly to ensure graphics are consistent.
- the [ukfsr-docs](https://github.com/FoodchainStats/ukfsr-docs) repo and [website](https://foodchainstats.github.io/ukfsr-docs/). Here we keep the style guide and all other guidance for the team producing the UKFSR, current and future.
